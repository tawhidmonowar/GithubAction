They can learn the patterns and styles of existing pieces and then create new ones that often sound convincingly human-made.  You can find AI-generated music on streaming services and AI-written poetry online.\n\n2. **AI helps train other AIs:**  A fascinating aspect of AI development is that more advanced AIs are frequently used to train less advanced ones or to optimize their performance. This is like a \"teacher AI\" helping its \"student AI\" learn more efficiently.\n\n3. **AI can beat humans at complex games â€“ but sometimes in surprising ways:** While AI's dominance in chess and Go is well-known,  the strategies AI employs sometimes defy human intuition. They might make moves that seem illogical or even suboptimal at first glance, but ultimately prove highly effective, showcasing different approaches to problem-solving than humans utilize.\n"
